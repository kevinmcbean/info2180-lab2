   <h2>My Favourite Cars</h2>
   <h4>September 29, 2022 by Kevin McBean</h4>
   <p><img class="left"src="leroy.jpg">I love all types of cars. Drag cars, Drift cars, Circuit cars, Time Attack cars, Offroad cars, Street cars, Show cars or Antique cars, you name it.
     I got into liking cars from playing video games like Gran Turismo 3 and 4 with my uncle when I was younger. I was also brought to Dover Raceway when
     I was a young teen and completely fell in love with the feeling of being around such adrenaline-inducing machinery. I began watching YouTube videos of
     racing and how to make cars go faster and just admired the true beauty that some of these cars possess.
      My all-time favourite car happens to be this stick-shift C5 Corvette with no body-panels which was the first GM stick-shift vehicle to ever do a sub 7 second 1/4 mile run.
     It makes around 1500hp on the dyno and makes the craziest of sounds when its brought to the limit. It belongs to a YouTuber known as Cleetus McFarland who's videos I watch religiously. I got the opportunity to watch it race in person at FL2K in Bradenton, Florida.</p>
   <p>Subarus are my favourite car brand. My uncles had Subarus growing up, one had a 1996 Subaru Impreza which he carried me to school in on many occassions and the other
     had a 2003 Subaru Forester which is still one of the fastest cars I've gotten to drive so far. I currently drive a stick-shift 1.5L Subaru Impreza which is a fun car
     to drive and get familiar with stickshift as it is slow enough to control at its limit while still being safe in most situations. The fastest car I've been in is not a Subaru however,
     but a 650whp Mitsubishi Evolution 8 that belongs to my cousin in Florida.</p>

   <h2>The Games I Play</h2>
   <h4>September 29, 2022 by Kevin McBean</h4>
   <p><img class="left" src="apex.jpg">I've been playing video games from a very young age and I am relatively decent at playing them. I started out playing on the PS2 with my uncle; games such as Max Payne, James Bond, GT3/4 and
     some more I can't remember. I always played online games but I eventually got to downloading Team Fortress 2 which I fell in love with and played for over 2000 hours (not kidding). I played other games too like CS:GO
     and whatever was in at the time but nothing really stood out to me until Valorant launched. I played that game everyday and even played in tournaments for fun.</p>
   <p>I eventually saved up and bought a PS5 where I downloaded Apex Legends so that I could play it with my friends. After actually getting to know how the game works, I ended up falling in love with it also and
     really put in the hours to get good at it (500 hours now). This was after also purchasing a gaming laptop that was able to run all the games I liked comfortably. My gaming setup is pretty simple, just a Dell G15 Laptop with a GTX1650 and 8GB RAM with
     a Razer Deathadder Essential gaming mouse and Razer mousepad.</p>
